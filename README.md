# MeditationUI

Simple UI using jetback compose 

I Used the basic Compose component.

Row : Children of the Row composable are placed one after another from left to right respectively.

Columen Children of the Column composable are placed one after another from top to bottom respectively.

Box : The children of the Box layout will be stacked over each other.

LazyVerticalGrid : composable provides experimental support for displaying items in a grid.

LazyColumen : The equivalent to the RecyclerView.

Canvas : The core composable for custom graphics.

Enjoy :)
